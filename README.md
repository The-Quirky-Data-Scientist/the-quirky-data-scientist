# Hi, I'm Sammi – The Quirky Data Scientist

Welcome! I'm a data scientist, content creator, and educator passionate about making technical concepts feel approachable, practical, and a little bit weird—in the best way.

I run **The Quirky Data Scientist**, a YouTube channel where I teach data science through real-world projects, storytelling, and beginner-friendly breakdowns. Whether you're new to data or brushing up your skills, I create content that bridges the gap between theory and actual doing.

## What I Focus On

- Cleaning messy, chaotic datasets and making sense of them
- Explaining machine learning and analytics in a way that *sticks*
- Building reproducible, portfolio-worthy projects in public
- Teaching through storytelling, humor, and hands-on demos

Right now, I'm building a library of video-supported projects to help learners not only understand how data science works—but to see it *work, work, work, work, work*.

## Current Series

- **Quirky Explainers** – 10-minute videos breaking down data science concepts with metaphors, analogies, and a touch of chaos
- **Real Projects in Public** – Walkthroughs of end-to-end data projects you can follow along with
- **Tool Tips & Tricks** – Practical tutorials for working smarter in Python, Colab, Sheets, and more

## Tech Stack & Tools

Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · SQL · Google Colab · Jupyter · Streamlit · Airflow · dbt · Regex · Markdown

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I've built (or am actively building) to support my content:

- **[Love at First Fit](https://github.com/...)**  
  A dating app dataset, modeled and explored through regression, recommendation systems, and romantic tropes.

- **[So You're a Data What?](https://github.com/...)**  
  A whimsical tour through data career roles—analyst, engineer, scientist, and more—using medieval court metaphors to explain modern job functions.

- **[Data Cleaning Demo Hub](https://github.com/...)**  
  A collection of messy files and cleaning walkthroughs to help learners practice real-world wrangling.

- **[EDA for the People](https://github.com/...)**  
  Exploratory data analysis notebooks designed for clarity, storytelling, and pattern discovery—not just pretty charts.

## How to Reach Me

I prefer to keep things simple—if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or ask questions:
- Use the **"Contact" button** at the top of this profile (enabled via GitHub)
- Or drop a comment on one of my YouTube videos

## What's Next

I'm currently:
- Publishing weekly content for beginner and intermediate data learners
- Developing a curriculum of project-based learning resources
- Experimenting with ways to teach LLMs, NLP, and AI with less jargon and more joy

Thanks for stopping by—and if you're learning data science too, you're in the right place.
